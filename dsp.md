I began experimenting with electronic audio in middle school, building 555
circuits and making beeps and metronomes for my own use in my Klezmer band and
the school wind ensemble. In high school, I used a Teensy microcontroller and
embedded C to make a simple beatbox that could simulate a flute, a guitar, and
white noise percussion.

I took a few relevant courses that involved DSP in college. One was a digital
music programming course, where we used MaxMSP to filter and shape music and
build ADSR synthesizers. We learned about the various components of real
instruments that we were simulating with DSP and the limitations of ADSR, and
tried to add in string sharping, the high-frequency string strike and other
elements for additional realism. Another course was Signals and Systems, where
we learned about how to implement digital filters of various kinds and how to
transform a signal from the time to the frequency domain with FFTs and back
again - this was a very math-heavy course. Part of this course also had us
taking a musical "fingerprint" of audio files to recognize music even in the
presence of noise. Yet another course I took was in Embedded Electronics and
Systems, where my project was a passive sonar system programmed in Verilog on
an FPGA, designed to locate noises in a room using an array of microphones.

Most recently I got interested in amateur radio. I passed at the Amateur Extra
level, which requires knowledge of Software-Defined Radio, heterodyning, FFTs,
quadrature encoding, Smith charts, the transmission line model, signal filters
and other signal processing topics that reviewed what I had learned in college.
