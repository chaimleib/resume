## Skills

* &gt;50 programming languages for different purposes, cross-pollinates concepts between them. Currently working with about seven programming languages (Go, JS, C#, PHP, Java, bash/zsh shell, awk)
* Designs recursively-linked data structures and algorithms
* Multithreaded, asynchronous and concurrent programming

## Work experience
### **Web Software Engineer and Microservices Architect, Evernote** (2016-current)

* Team process engineering - How can I make our work easy and fun? What will likely become a bottleneck? Is training/tooling/re-architecting the best way to solve this?
* Re-architected and migrated evernote.com from PHP with AWS to Go with Google App Engine. It lasted for five years and is still going strong (four previous attempts lived on average two years or less).
  * Designed and implemented Go, JSON content and HTML template organization to encourage modularizing and reusing HTML components.
  * Shell script, Node.js and Go tooling for deploy, preview, unit test, data-code consistency test, and code quality (npm/yarn, webpack, nvm/fnm, bash/zsh, rsync, node-sass/Dart SASS, prettier, eslint, goimports, golint-ci).
  * Crownpeak CMS support for codeless website content updates (C#, command-line SSH/SFTP, Google Cloud Storage).
    * Created Mac/Linux command-line tool for Crownpeak CMS in Go, to read, delete, un-delete, create, modify, and advanced-search for pages on the CMS. The web GUI was too slow, and this allowed scripting hundreds of actions at once, normally inconvenient or impossible using the restricted C# API alone. Discovered and implemented undocumented functions of the HTTP-based Crownpeak Connect API.
  * Created chainable command-line search tools in bash shell script to list assets related by (e.g.) shared JS sources, Go HTML template files, URLs, CMS content JSONs, etc. Answers frequent questions like "Which pages use this HTML component?" or the inverse, or "Which translation languages are available for this URL?" etc. (bash, awk, grep, sed, jq/yq, xargs, etc.)
  * Implemented caching and exponential backoff and retry for server-side requests in Go.
  * GeoIP lookups for country-specific sales events in Go.
  * Configured site health monitoring and reliability engineering using Google StackDriver logs, Google BigQuery logging, Pingdom, DataDog and PagerDuty.
  * Analytics via Google Analytics Commerce and Google BigQuery.
* Content Delivery Network (CDN) created from scratch using Google Cloud Storage for Iterable email assets.
* Maintained Wordpress blog in PHP (WPML, webpack, SCSS).
* Maintained customer-facing note editor in React, with Java backend.
* Jenkins continuous integration testing (BitBucket-Jenkins integration). No code changes are allowed into the master git branch unless the test suite passes.
* Google Cloud Platform for scaling, hosting, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, storage, secrets management. Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Optimizely experiments platform. Atlassian JIRA and Confluence, BitBucket, Jenkins, DataDog, PagerDuty. Go, Node.js/JavaScript, React, jquery, Typescript, C#, bash, MySQL, Docker, PHP.

### **Software Engineer, Coupa Software** (2015 – 2016)

Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, Turnip unit tests, Jenkins, and bash. Optimized RSpec test harness to work 30% faster; developed in-browser integration tests and unit tests; cooperated via AGILE with hundreds of developers using GitHub and Atlassian JIRA.

### **Software Engineer Intern, Rustici Software** (2014)

Created Python client library for TinCan API (xAPI 2.0) and created a JSON object verifier and recognizer using JSON Schema and Node.js/JavaScript. Worked on five-person team using GitHub.

### **Industrial Controls Engineer, Bridgestone** (2012)

Designed industrial controls and safety systems with AutoCAD Electrical, CoDeSys, and RSLogix. Coded PLCs in structured text (IEC 61131-3) and ladder logic, and created AutoCAD plugins with C#, Visual Basic, and LISP.

### **Computer Programmer Intern, Oak Ridge National Laboratory Physics Division** (2010)

Developed a cross-browser AJAX-based experiment log system; customized open-source software. Used PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, TinyMCE, ssh, vim, Red Hat Linux.

## Volunteer experience
### **Software Engineer, Chabad of the Greater South Bay** (2016 – 2020)

Maintained web site and redesigned UI using Bootstrap and AngularJS.

### **Web Engineer and Graphic Designer, Chabad of the East Bay** (2013-2014)

Programmed with Google Spreadsheets API, developed CiviCRM web site, and created vector logo in Inkscape and Illustrator.

## Technical knowledge & skills
**General**: Expert and actively working in Go, C#, JavaScript, bash and zsh shell, awk, and PHP. Recent work and personal project experience in Java, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, C, VB, and vimscript. Experience in more than 50 languages, picking up new ones quickly. Intimately familiar with git internals. Familiar with several IDEs, including Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ (and family), Xcode, Eclipse and others, while tending to use tmux and vim for daily drivers.

**Development process engineering**: Designs customized systems and operating procedures for the problem and the team, some of which have been battle-tested for five years and are still going strong.

**Security**: Strong awareness of potential attack vectors to help avoid developer-induced vulnerabilities. Keeps coworkers and customers protected as a matter of deep personal conviction to "do no harm," while allowing the power and flexibility to get the job done.

**Web technologies**: Experienced in React, AngularJS, SCSS, Webpack, MySQL, Rails, and Django for reactive, cross-browser, full stack web development.
