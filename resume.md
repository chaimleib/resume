## Goals

* Backend, full-stack, cloud, or embedded systems engineering
* Protect privacy, empower the customer

## Skills

**Coding**: More than 20 years of experience; first website at age 11. Recent work experience in _Go, C#, JavaScript/Node.js, TypeScript, Java, Python, MySQL, bash, zsh, ash and dash;_ less recent work in _Perl, PHP, Ruby, Visual Basic .Net, ladder logic, PLC structured text, LISP._ Education and personal project experience in _most of these and also C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, awk, Scheme, Matlab/Octave, Verilog._ Can write parallel and concurrent code. Creates _parsers, compilers and interpreters_ for new mini-languages. &gt;50 languages.

**Web technologies**: Full stack web and cloud development using _GCP and AWS; MySQL, NoSQL, ElasticSearch, Redis, CouchDB, React, Angular, jQuery, Webpack, npm/yarn, Docker, Kubernetes, SRE._

**Team process and systems engineering**: Designs build systems and cloud apps, and procedures for the problem and the team, some of which have been battle-tested for six years and are still going strong.

**Security and privacy**: Catches potential attack vectors at code review. Protects coworkers' and customers' privacy as a matter of deep personal conviction to "do no harm," while allowing the power and flexibility to get the job done, and done well.

**Algorithms and Data Structures**: _MaxMSP music synthesis and analysis, robot control, machine learning, OCR, pathfinding, 3D graphics and raytracing, operating systems_

**Continuous Integration Testing**: _Jenkins, TravisCI, CircleCI_

**Other**: Uses Arch Linux as daily driver. This resume was written in vim using Markdown and rendered with a Makefile.
